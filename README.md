## ‚ùó Issues Addressed

### 1. **Color Hexcode Format**
Flutter uses a hex format as `0xAARRGGBB`, where:
- `AA` is the alpha channel (transparency).
- `RR` is the red channel.
- `GG` is the green channel.
- `BB` is the blue channel.

#### Why `0xFF`?
- The `FF` in `0xFF` ensures the color is fully opaque.
- To adjust transparency, modify the alpha value (e.g., `0x806F0202` for 50% transparency).

### 2. **UI Spacing and Padding**
Maintaining consistent padding and spacing for the **Answer Box** was crucial. The `EdgeInsets` and `SizedBox` utilities were utilized to improve visual balance and alignment.
